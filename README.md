-- INTRO --

Starting my first project with TOP, which will review my knowledge of basic HTML and CSS, with a focus on flexbox. I am pretty comfortable with these concepts now, but I am interested to see what difficulties I come across.


-- REFLECTION --

Finished the project within 5 hours, and I didn't run into too many difficulties. I anticipated being overwhelmed by the idea of starting the project from a blank document, but it ended up not being as daunting as I expected once I got started. I began with the basic HTML setup, creating each piece of the webpage as its own section, which made things easier. I didn't start any CSS until I had the entire HTML doc set up, but I did go back to the HTML a couple times to add a few additional containers. After setting up the HTML, I went through the CSS section by section, and I didn't seem to have any trouble getting all of the sections to meld together well. 

About halfway through, I started realizing I was fighting the browser's default render settings, and I remembered something I learned back in a previous course I took. I implemented a seperate reset stylesheet to get rid of these pre-definied styles so I could work from scratch and set everything up the way I needed to, which worked out very well for me. One thing I wish TOP would have introduced earlier on (if they do at all) was the CSS reset since I think it is helpful to learn to style from nothing. Not only that, but every browser is different, so some of the landing page submissions may not look as intended on my browser, but they might look perfect on someone else's browser.
